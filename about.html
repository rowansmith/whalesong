                    <h4>Accommodation - Gansbaai - De Kelders</h4>

                    <p>An <span class="violet">intimate guest house on top of the rugged Cliffs of De Kelders</span>, offers you whale watching from the comfort of your bed! Stanley & Lainy Carpenter welcome you to their guesthouse Whale Song Lodge overlooking the picturesque Walker Bay with views of the coastline stretching from the white sand dunes of “Die Plaat“ past Hermanus all the way to Cape Point.
                    </p>

                    <p>Find seafront accommodation on South Africa´s whale coast which offers excellent land-based whale watching, shark cage diving, diverse fynbos, rugged coastal cliffs and deserted beaches; situated only 2 hr from Cape Town just before the fishing village of <span class="violet">Gansbaai famous for its Great White Sharks</span>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Why Whalesong Lodge guest house?</h4>

                    <p>De Kelders is north facing - <span class="violet">which is the sunny side in the southern hemisphere</span> - and one of the few places on the Whale Coast of South Africa where you are able to enjoy sundowners while watching the sun set over the Atlantic ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p>But the biggest reason is (and believe us these southern right whales are big!) there is no place in South Africa were you are able to watch the <span class="violet"> whales up-close from the shore</span> as you do from the De Kelders cliffs and the accommodation at Whale Song Lodge is on those cliffs only 70m from sea, you can't get closer unless you go for a swim!
                    </p>

                                <p>"We stayed at Whalesong Lodge May 2013. We had a great experience. The hotel is situated directly on the water (across a small street) beautiful view and peaceful. Everyone at the B&B was hospitable and the accomodations are exactly as advertised. When visiting South Africa I recommend small B&B's vs the larger hotels. Locals can recommend resturants and entertainment as well as providing a personal feel to your vacation. I strongly recommend Whalesong!</p>
                                <p><strong>Room Tip:</strong> I recommend paying a little extra and getting the corner room with a full balcony. Worth it!"<br /><span class="violet">Tonja J.</span></p>

                                <p>"Booked Whalesong after checking out reviews on Tripadvisor and so glad we did! Fabulous location, food, accommodation and service by hosts and staff. Unfortunately we only had one night there and that was our big mistake - not staying longer! The weather was wet but because of the location, the open fire, books to read and relaxed comfortable atmosphere this added to the experience so can only imagine any time of the year spent there would be special."<br /><span class="violet">Caty M.</span></p>

                                <p>The house has the most amazing views and is very relaxing.
                                My only disappointment was we didn't stay longer! We only booked overnight as we were going Shark diving! 
                                The owners went out of their way to welcome us and make our short stay comfortable.
                                Would recommend to any one going to the Gansbaai area."<br /><span class="violet">Lorraine M.</span></p>

                                <p>"Great experience. Lainy and Stanley really do a wonderful job. We spent some days here to finish our first trip to SA. Everything was fine for us. The suite with the promised view to the whalebay was more than we expected to have. We especially enjoyed the breakfast together with the other nice guests and you. Everything was prepared with love and great ideas."<br /><span class="violet">Dahmar G.</span></p>
